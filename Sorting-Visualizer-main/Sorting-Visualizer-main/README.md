# SORTING VISUALIZER
## Project description
- It is always a good way to transform abstract learning concepts into visualization and illustration.
- After seeing a friend making a sorting visualizer, I was so curious and decided to build my own sorting visualizer using JavaFx 
- The app provides visualizations for bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, shell sort, quick sort, and merge sort. It is so cool to see them work, especially with merge sort.
- The project used an IDE-generated Ant build script to build, run, and debug your project.
